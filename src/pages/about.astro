    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my new website
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back!
    </p>

    <p>A few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
      <li>I live in {identity.country}</li>
      <li>I work as a {identity.occupation}</li>
      <li>I enjoy {identity.hobbies.join(", ")}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are some of my skills:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => (
        <li class="skill">{skill}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>

    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
